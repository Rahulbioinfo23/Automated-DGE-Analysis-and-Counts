# Automated-DGE-Analysis-and-Counts
This R script filters the top table (generated by GEO2R in ".tsv") and gives counts, i.e. number of Gene symbols for different conditions.
Set the working directory where there are other ".tsv" files and run the script.
The OUTPUT will have counts for following conditions:
1)Significant genes(P.Value <= 0.05)
2)Upregulated/Overexpressed genes(P.Value <=0.05 and logFC > 0.05 (and 1))
3)Downregulated/Underexpressed genes(P.Value <=0.05 and logFC < -0.05 (and -1))
